## From CSV

- Closest query: "What are the total sales for each month of 2009?"
- SQL: "SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', InvoiceDate) AS Month, SUM(Total) AS MonthlySales FROM Invoice WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31' GROUP BY Month ORDER BY Month"

## QUERY

Given the following SQL query:

"SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', InvoiceDate) AS Month, SUM(Total) AS MonthlySales FROM Invoice WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31' GROUP BY Month ORDER BY Month"

Refactor this for the year of 2010 and order by largest monthly value

## CLAUDE

Here's the refactored SQL query for 2010, ordered by largest monthly sales value:

sql

SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', InvoiceDate) AS Month, SUM(Total) AS MonthlySales 
FROM Invoice 
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2010-01-01' AND '2010-12-31' 
GROUP BY Month 
ORDER BY MonthlySales DESC
The key changes made:
- 
- Updated the date range from 2009 to 2010 in the WHERE clause-
- Changed the ORDER BY clause from Month to MonthlySales DESC to sort by the largest monthly sales values first
- This will return the months from 2010 ranked from highest to lowest total sales.
