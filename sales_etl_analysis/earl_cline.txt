CLINE:

I have a CSV for some sales data. Make a simple ETL and data analysis programme for it to show plots and graphs. 

[There is a folder already called `sales_etl_analysis` - please ignore and start afresh]

COST: It cost $0.75 and output is in repo `sales_etl_analysis` along with `healthcare_noshows_pipeline'
