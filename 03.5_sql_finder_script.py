~ Using a retreived SQL I asked it to modify it to give me a different result.

given this SQL for the data already used, modify it to give the SQL for an artist called 'David Bowie'.

Here is a useful SQL

SELECT Track.Name AS TrackName, Album.Title AS AlbumTitle, Artist.Name AS ArtistName FROM Track JOIN Album ON Track.AlbumId = Album.AlbumId JOIN Artist ON Album.ArtistId = Artist.ArtistId

----------------
~ Claude's response
I'll modify the SQL query to filter for tracks by the artist "David Bowie".
Looking at the base query you provided, it retrieves track names along with their album titles and artist names. To filter this specifically for David Bowie, we need to add a WHERE clause that specifies the artist name.
Here's the modified SQL query:


SELECT Track.Name AS TrackName, Album.Title AS AlbumTitle, Artist.Name AS ArtistName 
FROM Track 
JOIN Album ON Track.AlbumId = Album.AlbumId 
JOIN Artist ON Album.ArtistId = Artist.ArtistId
WHERE Artist.Name = 'David Bowie'
This query will:

Join the Track, Album, and Artist tables
Filter the results to only include tracks where the artist name is 'David Bowie'
Return the track names, album titles, and artist name for all David Bowie tracks in the database

If you want to also sort the results, you could add an ORDER BY clause like this:

SELECT Track.Name AS TrackName, Album.Title AS AlbumTitle, Artist.Name AS ArtistName 
FROM Track 
JOIN Album ON Track.AlbumId = Album.AlbumId 
JOIN Artist ON Album.ArtistId = Artist.ArtistId
WHERE Artist.Name = 'David Bowie'
ORDER BY Album.Title, Track.Name

This would order the results first by album title and then by track name within each album.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Claude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses. 3.7 Sonnet
