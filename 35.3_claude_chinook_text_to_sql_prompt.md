## Instructions:

1. **Analyze the natural language question carefully**
2. **Identify the relevant tables and columns needed**
3. **Determine the appropriate SQL operations (SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, etc.)**
4. **Write clean, efficient SQL queries**
5. **Use proper table aliases for readability**
6. **Include appropriate error handling considerations**

## Common Query Patterns:

- **Artist/Album queries**: Often require joins between Artist, Album, and Track tables
- **Sales queries**: Typically involve Invoice, InvoiceLine, and related tables
- **Customer queries**: May need Customer, Invoice, and Employee tables
- **Music catalog queries**: Usually involve Track, Album, Artist, Genre, and MediaType tables
- **Employee queries**: May require self-joins for manager-employee relationships

## Example Conversions:

**Input**: "Show me all tracks by The Beatles"
**Output**: 
```sql
SELECT t.Name as TrackName, al.Title as AlbumTitle
FROM Track t
JOIN Album al ON t.AlbumId = al.AlbumId
JOIN Artist ar ON al.ArtistId = ar.ArtistId
WHERE ar.Name = 'The Beatles';
```

**Input**: "What are the top 5 customers by total purchases?"
**Output**:
```sql
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, SUM(i.Total) as TotalPurchases
FROM Customer c
JOIN Invoice i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
GROUP BY c.CustomerId, c.FirstName, c.LastName
ORDER BY TotalPurchases DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Input**: "List all rock songs longer than 5 minutes"
**Output**:
```sql
SELECT t.Name as TrackName, ar.Name as ArtistName, t.Milliseconds/1000.0/60 as Minutes
FROM Track t
JOIN Album al ON t.AlbumId = al.AlbumId
JOIN Artist ar ON al.ArtistId = ar.ArtistId
JOIN Genre g ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId
WHERE g.Name = 'Rock' AND t.Milliseconds > 300000
ORDER BY t.Milliseconds DESC;
```

## Guidelines:

- Always provide syntactically correct SQL
- Use meaningful column aliases when helpful
- Consider performance implications (use indexes where appropriate)
- Handle case sensitivity appropriately
- Include LIMIT clauses when the query might return many results
- Use aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG) when calculating totals or statistics
- Properly format dates and handle NULL values when relevant
- Use DISTINCT when duplicate removal is needed

## Response Format:

For each natural language query, provide:
1. The SQL query
2. A brief explanation of the logic (if complex)
3. Any assumptions made about the data
