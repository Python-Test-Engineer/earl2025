# Data Cleaning Analysis for Patient Appointment Data

After reviewing the provided CSV content, I've identified several areas that need cleaning. Here's the analysis and Python code to clean the data.

## Issues Identified:
1. Date columns are in string format and need to be converted to datetime
2. Boolean columns (Hipertension, Diabetes, etc.) are represented as 0/1 but should be boolean
3. "No-show" column has "Yes/No" values, which should be converted to boolean
4. Check for missing values
5. Patient and Appointment IDs are very large numbers and may not be useful in their current format
6. The column names could be standardized for better readability

## Python Code to Clean the Data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import io
from base64 import b64decode

# Assuming the file content is base64 encoded
decoded_content = b64decode(file_content).decode('utf-8')
df = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(decoded_content))

# 1. Standardize column names
df.columns = [col.lower().replace('-', '_') for col in df.columns]

# 2. Convert date columns to datetime
df['scheduled_day'] = pd.to_datetime(df['scheduledday'])
df['appointment_day'] = pd.to_datetime(df['appointmentday'])

# 3. Calculate days between scheduling and appointment
df['days_until_appointment'] = (df['appointment_day'] - df['scheduled_day']).dt.days

# 4. Convert binary columns to boolean
binary_cols = ['hipertension', 'diabetes', 'alcoholism', 'handcap', 'scholarship']
for col in binary_cols:
    df[col] = df[col].astype(bool)

# 5. Convert No-show to boolean (True if patient didn't show up)
df['no_show'] = df['no_show'] == 'Yes'

# 6. Check for missing values
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()

# 7. Convert ID columns to string for better handling
df['patientid'] = df['patientid'].astype(str)
df['appointmentid'] = df['appointmentid'].astype(str)

# 8. Standardize gender column
df['gender'] = df['gender'].str.upper()

# 9. Display information about the cleaned dataset
print(f"Dataset shape: {df.shape}")
print("Missing values:")
print(missing_values)
print("\nSample of cleaned data:")
print(df.head())

# Save the cleaned data
df.to_csv('cleaned_appointments.csv', index=False)
```

This code performs the necessary cleaning tasks while keeping the implementation simple. It handles date conversions, boolean transformations, and adds a useful feature (days until appointment). It also checks for missing values and standardizes the column names and values for better consistency.

Note: The actual transformation might need adjustments based on deeper analysis of the data patterns, but this provides a solid starting point for cleaning the dataset.
