# Data Analysis and Cleaning for Medical Appointment Dataset

After analyzing the provided CSV data, which appears to be a dataset related to medical appointments, I'll identify the necessary cleaning actions and provide the corresponding Python code.

## Analysis of the Data

The dataset contains information about medical appointments, including patient details, appointment scheduling, medical conditions, and whether the patient showed up for the appointment.

Key issues identified:
1. Date fields need parsing
2. Data types need correction
3. Some fields may have inconsistent formatting
4. Age value of 8 might need validation (or other age outliers)
5. Encoded text fields (neighborhood names)
6. Binary fields need consistent format

## Cleaning Actions and Python Code

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('DATA_FILE')

# 1. Convert date columns to datetime
df['ScheduledDay'] = pd.to_datetime(df['ScheduledDay'])
df['AppointmentDay'] = pd.to_datetime(df['AppointmentDay'])

# 2. Create a feature for days between scheduling and appointment
df['DaysBetween'] = (df['AppointmentDay'] - df['ScheduledDay']).dt.days

# 3. Check and handle age outliers
print(f"Age statistics: Min={df['Age'].min()}, Max={df['Age'].max()}, Mean={df['Age'].mean():.2f}")
# Optionally filter out unreasonable ages
# df = df[(df['Age'] >= 0) & (df['Age'] <= 120)]

# 4. Convert binary columns to proper boolean
binary_cols = ['Scholarship', 'Hipertension', 'Diabetes', 'Alcoholism', 'Handcap', 'SMS_received']
for col in binary_cols:
    df[col] = df[col].astype(bool)

# 5. Convert No-show to boolean
df['No-show'] = df['No-show'].map({'Yes': True, 'No': False})

# 6. Check for duplicate appointments
duplicates = df.duplicated(subset=['PatientId', 'AppointmentDay'], keep=False)
print(f"Number of duplicate appointments: {duplicates.sum()}")

# 7. Check for missing values
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
print("Missing values by column:")
print(missing_values[missing_values > 0])

# 8. Create a cleaned dataset
df_clean = df.copy()

# Display the first few rows of cleaned data
print(df_clean.head())

# Save the cleaned dataset
df_clean.to_csv('cleaned_appointments.csv', index=False)
```

## Additional Observations

1. The `PatientId` and `AppointmentID` appear to be unique identifiers.
2. The dataset contains medical conditions like hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, and disability.
3. The `No-show` column indicates whether the patient missed their appointment.
4. The time component in the dates might be relevant for analysis.
5. The age distribution should be examined more closely to validate the data.
6. Neighborhood names are in capital letters and some have special characters, which might need standardization.

This code performs basic cleaning while preserving the original data structure. Additional domain-specific cleaning could be performed based on further requirements or analyses.
