# Data Analysis and Cleaning for Medical Appointment Dataset

After analyzing the provided CSV content, I've identified several cleaning actions needed. Let's look at the dataset first and then implement the necessary cleaning steps.

## Analysis of the Data

The dataset appears to contain medical appointment information with the following columns:
- PatientId: Unique identifier for patients
- AppointmentID: Unique identifier for appointments
- Gender: Patient gender (F/M)
- ScheduledDay: When the appointment was scheduled
- AppointmentDay: The actual day of the appointment
- Age: Patient age
- Neighbourhood: Location
- Scholarship: Binary indicator (likely for financial aid)
- Hipertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Handcap: Health conditions (binary)
- SMS_received: Whether SMS reminder was sent
- No-show: Whether the patient missed the appointment (Yes/No)

## Issues to Clean:

1. Date columns need conversion to datetime
2. Potentially inconsistent encoding in 'Neighbourhood' (contains accented characters)
3. Age column has an outlier (8 years old) that should be verified
4. 'Handcap' is misspelled (should be 'Handicap')
5. 'No-show' should be converted to boolean
6. 'Hipertension' is misspelled (should be 'Hypertension')
7. Binary health condition columns should be consistent (0/1)

## Python Code for Cleaning

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('DATA_FILE')

# 1. Convert date columns to datetime format
df['ScheduledDay'] = pd.to_datetime(df['ScheduledDay'])
df['AppointmentDay'] = pd.to_datetime(df['AppointmentDay'])

# 2. Create a feature for days between scheduling and appointment
df['Days_Diff'] = (df['AppointmentDay'] - df['ScheduledDay']).dt.days

# 3. Fix column names for consistency
df = df.rename(columns={
    'Hipertension': 'Hypertension',
    'Handcap': 'Handicap',
    'No-show': 'NoShow'
})

# 4. Convert No-show to boolean
df['NoShow'] = df['NoShow'].map({'Yes': True, 'No': False})

# 5. Check for age outliers (optional removal)
print(f"Age range: {df['Age'].min()} to {df['Age'].max()}")
# Filter out unreasonable ages if needed (e.g., negative or extremely high)
df = df[df['Age'] >= 0]

# 6. Convert binary health condition columns to consistent boolean
for col in ['Scholarship', 'Hypertension', 'Diabetes', 'Alcoholism', 'Handicap', 'SMS_received']:
    df[col] = df[col].astype(bool)

# 7. Check for duplicate appointments
duplicates = df.duplicated(subset=['PatientId', 'AppointmentDay'], keep=False)
print(f"Number of duplicate appointments: {duplicates.sum()}")

# 8. Final data info
print(df.info())
print(df.describe())

# Save cleaned data
df.to_csv('cleaned_appointments.csv', index=False)
```

This code addresses the main cleaning requirements while keeping the process simple. Depending on the specific analysis goals, you might want to implement additional cleaning steps or transformations.
