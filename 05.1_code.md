**Imputing Missing Values with Mean of Column**
=====================================================

Here's a Python implementation using Pandas to impute missing values in a DataFrame with the mean of the respective column.

### Code

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def impute_with_mean(df):
    """
    Impute missing values in a DataFrame with the mean of the respective column.

    Args:
    - df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing missing values.

    Returns:
    - df_imputed (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame with missing values imputed.
    """
    # Create a copy of the original DataFrame to avoid modifying it
    df_imputed = df.copy()

    # Iterate over each column in the DataFrame
    for col in df_imputed.columns:
        # Check if the column contains missing values
        if df_imputed[col].isnull().any():
            # Calculate the mean of the column (excluding missing values)
            mean_value = df_imputed[col].mean()

            # Replace missing values in the column with the mean value
            df_imputed[col] = df_imputed[col].fillna(mean_value)

    return df_imputed

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a sample DataFrame with missing values
    data = {
        "A": [1, 2, np.nan, 4, 5],
        "B": [6, np.nan, 8, 9, 10],
        "C": [11, 12, 13, np.nan, 15]
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    print("Original DataFrame:")
    print(df)

    # Impute missing values with the mean of the column
    df_imputed = impute_with_mean(df)

    print("\nDataFrame with missing values imputed:")
    print(df_imputed)
```

### Explanation

1. The `impute_with_mean` function takes a Pandas DataFrame as input and returns a new DataFrame with missing values imputed.
2. It iterates over each column in the DataFrame, checks for missing values, and calculates the mean of the column (excluding missing values) using the `mean()` method.
3. Missing values in the column are replaced with the calculated mean value using the `fillna()` method.
4. The imputed DataFrame is returned.

### Example Use Case

The example usage demonstrates how to create a sample DataFrame with missing values, impute the missing values using the `impute_with_mean` function, and print the original and imputed DataFrames.
