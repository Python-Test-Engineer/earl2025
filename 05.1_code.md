**ReAct Thought-Observer Architecture Implementation in Python**
=================================================================

### Introduction

The ReAct thought-observer architecture is a cognitive architecture that simulates human thought processes by using a combination of reactive and deliberative reasoning. This implementation provides a basic framework for an AI agent that uses the ReAct architecture.

### Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* NumPy library (`pip install numpy`)

### Code

```python
import numpy as np

class ReActAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_space, action_space):
        """
        Initializes the ReAct agent.

        Args:
        - state_space (list): List of possible states.
        - action_space (list): List of possible actions.
        """
        self.state_space = state_space
        self.action_space = action_space
        self.current_state = None
        self.beliefs = {}  # Beliefs about the current state
        self.goals = []  # Current goals
        self.intentions = []  # Current intentions

    def observe(self, observation):
        """
        Updates the agent's beliefs based on new observations.

        Args:
        - observation (dict): Dictionary containing the observed state features.
        """
        # Update beliefs based on observation
        for feature, value in observation.items():
            self.beliefs[feature] = value

        # Update current state
        self.current_state = self._determine_state(self.beliefs)

    def _determine_state(self, beliefs):
        """
        Determines the current state based on the agent's beliefs.

        Args:
        - beliefs (dict): Dictionary containing the agent's beliefs about the current state.

        Returns:
        - state (str): The current state.
        """
        # TO DO: Implement state determination based on beliefs
        # For now, just return a random state
        return np.random.choice(self.state_space)

    def reason(self):
        """
        Performs deliberative reasoning to update the agent's goals and intentions.
        """
        # TO DO: Implement reasoning based on current state, goals, and intentions
        # For now, just print a message
        print("Reasoning...")

    def act(self):
        """
        Selects an action based on the agent's current intentions.

        Returns:
        - action (str): The selected action.
        """
        # TO DO: Implement action selection based on intentions
        # For now, just return a random action
        return np.random.choice(self.action_space)

    def run(self, observations):
        """
        Runs the ReAct agent for a given sequence of observations.

        Args:
        - observations (list): List of observations.
        """
        for observation in observations:
            self.observe(observation)
            self.reason()
            action = self.act()
            print(f"Action: {action}")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    state_space = ["state1", "state2", "state3"]
    action_space = ["action1", "action2", "action3"]
    agent = ReActAgent(state_space, action_space)
    observations = [{"feature1": "value1", "feature2": "value2"}, {"feature1": "value3", "feature2": "value4"}]
    agent.run(observations)
```

### Explanation

This implementation provides a basic framework for an AI agent that uses the ReAct thought-observer architecture. The agent has the following components:

* `state_space`: A list of possible states.
* `action_space`: A list of possible actions.
* `beliefs`: A dictionary containing the agent's beliefs about the current state.
* `goals`: A list of current goals.
* `intentions`: A list of current intentions.
* `observe`: A method that updates the agent's beliefs based on new observations.
* `reason`: A method that performs deliberative reasoning to update the agent's goals and intentions.
* `act`: A method that selects an action based on the agent's current intentions.
* `run`: A method that runs the ReAct agent for a given sequence of observations.

The example usage demonstrates how to create a ReAct agent, define a sequence of observations, and run the agent.

### TO DO

* Implement state determination based on beliefs.
* Implement reasoning based on current state, goals, and intentions.
* Implement action selection based on intentions.

Note: This is a simplified implementation and may not fully capture the complexity of the ReAct thought-observer architecture.
