# Model Context Protocal (MCP)

As humans, we often do the following:

Search or get a list of all available tools.
- Select the best tool.
- Get the details of how to implement it.
- Implement it and get a result.

How does an AI Agent do this (discovery and implementation)?

This is the basis of the Model Context Protocal.

Think HTTP protocol for example.

Thus in time, our apps may well be a collection of AI Agents that use 3rd party tools that are speicalist and highly developed, in the same way we use deterministically, Numpy, Pandas etc.

## Agent 2 Agent (A2A)

Google's proposal that complements MCP.

Agents can talk to other Agents.
