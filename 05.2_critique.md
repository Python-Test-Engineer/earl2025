**Critique and Recommendations**

The provided code is well-structured and readable. However, there are a few areas that can be improved for better functionality and robustness.

### 1. Handling Non-Numeric Columns

The original function did not handle non-numeric columns. The revised function now includes an option to impute non-numeric columns with a specified value. This is a good improvement, but it can be further enhanced by providing more options for imputing non-numeric columns, such as imputing with the mode or a custom value.

### 2. Handling Columns with All NaN Values

The revised function checks if a column has all NaN values before attempting to impute with the mean. This is a good improvement, as it prevents unnecessary calculations and potential errors.

### 3. Error Handling

The function does not include any error handling. It assumes that the input is a Pandas DataFrame and that the columns are either numeric or non-numeric. However, in a real-world scenario, the input may not always be valid. Adding error handling to check the input type and handle potential errors can make the function more robust.

### 4. Type Hints and Documentation

The function includes a docstring that describes its purpose, parameters, and return value. However, it can be further improved by adding type hints for the parameters and return value. This can make the code more readable and self-documenting.

### 5. Example Usage

The example usage demonstrates how to create a sample DataFrame with missing values, impute the missing values, and print the original and imputed DataFrames. This is a good way to illustrate the function's usage, but it can be further improved by including more examples that demonstrate different scenarios, such as handling non-numeric columns or columns with all NaN values.

### Revised Code with Recommendations

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def impute_with_mean(df: pd.DataFrame, impute_non_numeric: any = None) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Imputes missing values in a Pandas DataFrame with the mean of the corresponding column.

    Args:
        df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame with missing values.
        impute_non_numeric (any, optional): Value to impute non-numeric columns with. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: DataFrame with missing values imputed.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the input is not a Pandas DataFrame.
    """
    # Check if the input is a Pandas DataFrame
    if not isinstance(df, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a Pandas DataFrame")

    # Iterate over each column in the DataFrame
    for col in df.columns:
        # Check if the column contains numeric values
        if pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(df[col]):
            # Calculate the mean of the column, ignoring missing values
            mean_val = df[col].mean(skipna=True)
            # Check if the mean is not NaN (i.e., the column is not all NaN)
            if not np.isnan(mean_val):
                # Replace missing values with the mean
                df[col] = df[col].fillna(mean_val)
            else:
                print(f"Column {col} has all NaN values. Cannot impute with mean.")
        else:
            # Impute non-numeric columns with the specified value
            if impute_non_numeric is not None:
                df[col] = df[col].fillna(impute_non_numeric)
    
    return df

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a sample DataFrame with missing values
    data = {
        'A': [1, 2, np.nan, 4, 5],
        'B': [np.nan, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        'C': ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', np.nan]
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    print("Original DataFrame:")
    print(df)

    # Impute missing values with the mean
    df_imputed = impute_with_mean(df, impute_non_numeric='unknown')
    print("\nDataFrame with missing values imputed:")
    print(df_imputed)

    # Test error handling
    try:
        impute_with_mean("invalid input")
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"\nError: {e}")
```

This revised code includes type hints, improved error handling, and additional examples to demonstrate different scenarios. It also includes a `Raises` section in the docstring to document the potential errors that can be raised by the function.
