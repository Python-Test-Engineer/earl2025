### Code Review

The provided Python code is well-structured, readable, and effectively utilizes the Pandas library to impute missing values in a DataFrame with the mean of the respective column. Here's a comprehensive review of the code, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement:

#### Strengths:

1. **Clear documentation**: The code is well-documented with a clear description of the function's purpose, arguments, and return values.
2. **Consistent naming conventions**: The code adheres to PEP 8 naming conventions, making it easy to read and understand.
3. **Proper use of libraries**: The code effectively utilizes the Pandas and NumPy libraries for data manipulation and calculation.
4. **Example usage**: The code includes an example usage section, demonstrating how to apply the function to a sample DataFrame.

#### Weaknesses and Suggestions:

1. **Error handling**: The code does not include error handling for potential issues, such as:
	* Empty DataFrames
	* DataFrames with all missing values in a column
	* Non-numeric columns that may require different imputation strategies
	* DataFrames with mixed data types (e.g., numeric and categorical)
2. **Performance**: The code iterates over each column in the DataFrame, which may not be efficient for large datasets. Consider using vectorized operations or Pandas' built-in methods for better performance.
3. **Type hinting**: The function argument and return types can be specified using type hints for better code readability and maintainability.
4. **Considerations for non-numeric columns**: The code assumes that non-numeric columns do not require imputation. If this is not the case, additional logic can be added to handle non-numeric columns differently.
5. **Mean calculation**: The code uses the `df[col].mean()` method to calculate the mean of the column. However, this method may not be suitable for columns with a large number of missing values. Consider using a more robust method, such as `df[col].dropna().mean()`.

#### Refactored Code

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def impute_missing_values_with_mean(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Impute missing values in a Pandas DataFrame with the mean of the column.

    Args:
        df (pd.DataFrame): Input DataFrame.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: DataFrame with missing values imputed.
    """
    # Check for empty DataFrame
    if df.empty:
        raise ValueError("Input DataFrame is empty")

    # Iterate over each column in the DataFrame
    for col in df.columns:
        # Check if the column contains numeric data
        if pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(df[col]):
            # Calculate the mean of the non-missing values in the column
            mean_value = df[col].dropna().mean()
            
            # Check if the mean value is not NaN (avoid division by zero)
            if not np.isnan(mean_value):
                # Replace missing values with the mean of the column
                df[col] = df[col].fillna(mean_value)
            else:
                # Handle the case where the mean value is NaN (e.g., all missing values)
                print(f"Column '{col}' has all missing values. Skipping imputation.")

    return df

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a sample DataFrame
    data = {
        'A': [1, 2, np.nan, 4, 5],
        'B': [np.nan, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        'C': ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    print("Original DataFrame:")
    print(df)

    # Impute missing values with the mean of the column
    imputed_df = impute_missing_values_with_mean(df)

    print("\nDataFrame with missing values imputed:")
    print(imputed_df)
```

The refactored code includes error handling for empty DataFrames, calculates the mean of non-missing values in each column, and provides a more robust method for handling non-numeric columns. Additionally, the code includes type hinting for better readability and maintainability.
