**Code Review and Recommendations**
=====================================

### Overall Impression

The provided code is well-structured, readable, and correctly implements the imputation of missing values using the mean of each column. The use of clear and concise docstrings, proper naming conventions, and a separate function for imputation makes the code easy to understand and maintain.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Error Handling**: The code does not include any error handling mechanisms. For example, it does not check if the input is a Pandas DataFrame or if the DataFrame is empty. Adding try-except blocks and input validation can make the code more robust and prevent unexpected errors.
2. **Performance**: The current implementation uses a loop to iterate over each column in the DataFrame. For large DataFrames, this can be inefficient. Consider using the `apply()` method or vectorized operations to improve performance.
3. **Type Hinting**: The function parameters and return types are not annotated with type hints. Adding type hints can improve code readability and help catch type-related errors.
4. **Constant Values**: The code uses `np.nan` directly. Consider defining a constant value for missing values to make the code more readable and maintainable.
5. **Example Usage**: The example usage is clear, but it would be beneficial to demonstrate more complex scenarios, such as handling non-numeric columns or DataFrames with multiple data types.

### Updated Code

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

MISSING_VALUE = np.nan

def impute_with_mean(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Impute missing values in a DataFrame with the mean of the respective column.

    Args:
    - df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing missing values.

    Returns:
    - df_imputed (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame with missing values imputed.
    """
    try:
        if not isinstance(df, pd.DataFrame):
            raise ValueError("Input must be a Pandas DataFrame")

        if df.empty:
            raise ValueError("Input DataFrame is empty")

        # Create a copy of the original DataFrame to avoid modifying it
        df_imputed = df.copy()

        # Iterate over each column in the DataFrame
        for col in df_imputed.columns:
            # Check if the column contains missing values
            if df_imputed[col].isnull().any():
                # Calculate the mean of the column (excluding missing values)
                mean_value = df_imputed[col].mean()

                # Replace missing values in the column with the mean value
                df_imputed[col] = df_imputed[col].fillna(mean_value)

        return df_imputed

    except ValueError as ve:
        print(f"Error: {ve}")
        return None

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a sample DataFrame with missing values
    data = {
        "A": [1, 2, MISSING_VALUE, 4, 5],
        "B": [6, MISSING_VALUE, 8, 9, 10],
        "C": [11, 12, 13, MISSING_VALUE, 15]
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    print("Original DataFrame:")
    print(df)

    # Impute missing values with the mean of the column
    df_imputed = impute_with_mean(df)

    if df_imputed is not None:
        print("\nDataFrame with missing values imputed:")
        print(df_imputed)
```

### Performance Improvement

To improve performance, you can use the `apply()` method or vectorized operations. Here's an example using the `apply()` method:

```python
def impute_with_mean(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Impute missing values in a DataFrame with the mean of the respective column.

    Args:
    - df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing missing values.

    Returns:
    - df_imputed (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame with missing values imputed.
    """
    try:
        if not isinstance(df, pd.DataFrame):
            raise ValueError("Input must be a Pandas DataFrame")

        if df.empty:
            raise ValueError("Input DataFrame is empty")

        # Create a copy of the original DataFrame to avoid modifying it
        df_imputed = df.copy()

        # Apply the imputation function to each column
        df_imputed = df_imputed.apply(lambda x: x.fillna(x.mean()))

        return df_imputed

    except ValueError as ve:
        print(f"Error: {ve}")
        return None
```

This implementation uses the `apply()` method to apply the imputation function to each column in the DataFrame. This can improve performance for large DataFrames. However, the performance improvement will depend on the specific use case and the size of the DataFrame.
