### Revised Code with Enhanced Error Handling and Performance

The revised code includes additional error handling for potential issues, such as DataFrames with mixed data types, and utilizes Pandas' built-in methods for better performance.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def impute_missing_values_with_mean(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Impute missing values in a Pandas DataFrame with the mean of the column.

    Args:
        df (pd.DataFrame): Input DataFrame.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: DataFrame with missing values imputed.
    """
    # Check for empty DataFrame
    if df.empty:
        raise ValueError("Input DataFrame is empty")

    # Check for mixed data types in DataFrame
    if not all(isinstance(dtype, (np.dtype('int64'), np.dtype('float64'))) for dtype in df.dtypes):
        print("Warning: DataFrame contains mixed data types. Non-numeric columns will be skipped.")

    # Iterate over each column in the DataFrame
    for col in df.columns:
        # Check if the column contains numeric data
        if pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(df[col]):
            # Calculate the mean of the non-missing values in the column
            mean_value = df[col].dropna().mean()
            
            # Check if the mean value is not NaN (avoid division by zero)
            if not np.isnan(mean_value):
                # Replace missing values with the mean of the column
                df[col] = df[col].fillna(mean_value)
            else:
                # Handle the case where the mean value is NaN (e.g., all missing values)
                print(f"Column '{col}' has all missing values. Skipping imputation.")
        else:
            # Handle non-numeric columns
            print(f"Column '{col}' is non-numeric. Skipping imputation.")

    return df

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a sample DataFrame
    data = {
        'A': [1, 2, np.nan, 4, 5],
        'B': [np.nan, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        'C': ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'],
        'D': [np.nan, np.nan, np.nan, np.nan, np.nan]
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    print("Original DataFrame:")
    print(df)

    # Impute missing values with the mean of the column
    imputed_df = impute_missing_values_with_mean(df)

    print("\nDataFrame with missing values imputed:")
    print(imputed_df)
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Additional error handling has been added to check for mixed data types in the DataFrame. A warning message is printed if the DataFrame contains non-numeric columns, and these columns are skipped during the imputation process.
2. **Improved Performance**: Pandas' built-in methods are utilized to calculate the mean of non-missing values in each column, which provides better performance compared to manual iteration.
3. **Handling Non-Numeric Columns**: The code now handles non-numeric columns by printing a message indicating that the column is non-numeric and skipping imputation for that column.
4. **Example Usage**: An updated example usage section demonstrates the function's application to a sample DataFrame with mixed data types and a column with all missing values.

### Opinion on Code Quality

The revised code has improved significantly with the addition of enhanced error handling, improved performance, and handling of non-numeric columns. The code is now more robust and can handle a wider range of input DataFrames. However, there is still room for improvement, such as adding more comprehensive documentation and considering alternative imputation strategies for non-numeric columns. Overall, the code quality is good, and with further refinements, it can become even more reliable and efficient.
