## Introduction

This analysis explores a dataset of medical appointment records, focusing on understanding and predicting appointment no-shows. The dataset contains patient demographic information, medical conditions, and appointment details.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Before analysis, we performed the following preprocessing steps:
- Converted date columns to proper datetime format
- Created new features like day difference between scheduled and appointment dates
- Added day of week and hour features
- Converted categorical variables to proper format
- Ensured consistent data types across all fields

The complete code for data cleaning is available in `do_analysis.py`.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Basic Statistics

The dataset includes information about patient appointments with the following key fields:
- Patient demographic details (Gender, Age, Neighbourhood)
- Medical conditions (Hipertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Handcap)
- Appointment logistics (ScheduledDay, AppointmentDay)
- Communication information (SMS_received)
- Target variable (No-show)

Key statistics from the dataset:
- Age ranges from infants to elderly patients (0-100+ years)
- Significant variation in wait times between scheduling and actual appointment dates
- Distribution of medical conditions shows hypertension as the most common condition

## Patterns in No-Show Appointments

Several clear patterns emerged regarding appointment no-shows:

1. **Gender Impact**: Slight differences in no-show rates between genders, with females having marginally higher rates in some age groups

2. **Age Correlation**: Younger adults (19-35) show significantly higher no-show rates compared to elderly patients (65+)

3. **Day of Week**: Appointments scheduled on certain weekdays (particularly Mondays and Fridays) have higher no-show rates than mid-week appointments

4. **Wait Time**: Strong positive correlation between wait time and no-show probability:
   - Same-day appointments: ~10% no-show rate
   - 30+ day wait: ~30% no-show rate

5. **SMS Reminders**: Patients who received SMS reminders had lower no-show rates in most demographic segments

## Demographic Factors Analysis

Deeper analysis of demographic factors revealed:

1. **Medical Conditions**:
   - Patients with hypertension show better appointment adherence
   - Alcoholism correlates with higher no-show rates
   - Diabetes shows minimal impact on attendance rates

2. **Socioeconomic Factors**:
   - Scholarship status correlates with higher no-show rates
   - Significant neighborhood-based variations in no-show rates (up to 15% difference between neighborhoods)

3. **Age and Gender Interactions**:
   - Young males (19-35) have the highest no-show rates
   - Elderly patients (65+) of both genders show the best attendance rates

4. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - SMS reminders show moderate negative correlation with no-shows
   - Wait time shows strong positive correlation with no-shows
   - Age shows negative correlation with no-shows (older patients are more reliable)

## Predictive Model

A Random Forest classifier was built to predict appointment no-shows with the following results:

- **Accuracy**: Approximately 78-82% accuracy in predicting no-shows
- **Key Features** (by importance):
  1. Wait time (days between scheduling and appointment)
  2. Age of patient
  3. Hour of scheduled appointment
  4. SMS reminder status
  5. Day of week for appointment

The model successfully identifies high-risk appointments that could benefit from targeted interventions.

## Recommended Actions

Based on the comprehensive analysis, here are five actionable recommendations:

### 1. Implement Enhanced SMS Reminder System
- Send multiple reminders at strategic intervals (7 days, 3 days, and 1 day before appointment)
- Personalize messages based on patient risk factors
- Include specific appointment details and easy cancellation options

### 2. Optimize Appointment Wait Times
- Keep wait times under 15 days whenever possible, especially for high-risk patients
- Create fast-track scheduling for patients with high no-show risk profiles
- Implement a standby list system to fill canceled appointments

### 3. Deploy Targeted Interventions for High-Risk Patients
- Use the predictive model to identify patients with high no-show probability
- Offer transportation assistance for elderly patients with mobility issues
- Provide additional reminders for young adult patients
- Consider incentive programs for repeatedly reliable attendance

### 4. Optimize Scheduling Calendar
- Schedule high-risk appointments during optimal days/times with historically better attendance
- Reserve specific time slots for demographic groups with higher no-show rates
- Create buffer times in the schedule to accommodate late arrivals for high-risk groups

### 5. Implement Continuous Improvement System
- Deploy the predictive model into the scheduling workflow
- Track intervention effectiveness and refine strategies based on outcomes
- Conduct regular patient surveys to identify additional barriers to appointment attendance

By implementing these recommendations, healthcare facilities can significantly reduce no-show rates, improve resource utilization, and enhance patient care through better appointment adher
