## Content

110,527 medical appointments its 14 associated variables (characteristics). The most important one if the patient show-up or no-show to the appointment. Variable names are self-explanatory, if you have doubts, just let me know!

14 variables

## Data Dictionary

01 - PatientId - Identification of a patient

02 - AppointmentID - Identification of each appointment

03 - Gender - Male or Female . Female is the greater proportion, woman takes way more care of they health in comparison to man.

04 - DataMarcacaoConsulta -The day of the actuall appointment, when they have to visit the doctor.

05 - DataAgendamento - The day someone called or registered the appointment, this is before appointment of course.

06 - Age - How old is the patient.
07 - Neighbourhood - Where the appointment takes place.

08 - Scholarship - True of False . Observation, this is a broad topic, consider reading this article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsa_Fam%C3%ADlia

09 - Hipertension - True or False

10 - Diabetes - True or False

11 - Alcoholism - True or False

12 - Handcap - True or False

13 - SMS_received - 1 or more messages sent to the patient.

14 - No-show - True or False.

What if that possible to predict someone to no-show an appointment?


### DNA

Patients who fail to show up for an appointment are a major challenge to medical providers. Understanding no-shows and predicting them are keys to developing a proactive strategy in healthcare operations. In this study, we propose a data analytics framework to explore the underlying factors of no-shows via various machine learning models to predict whether a patient is a no-show. The analytics results reveal key patterns in no-show patients. We also propose a methodology to integrate the prediction model with a Bayesian inference system to create an overbooking decision support tool that allows variable overbooking rates in different time windows.

Medical appointment no-shows are a problem in essentially all healthcare centers, and have a significant impact on revenues, costs and the use of resources. Also referred as missed appointments, the no-show states the patient’s behavior who neither attend nor cancel their medical appointments. Long waiting lines for a particular medical resource, hindering health system access for other patients and financial loss are well-known consequences that the patients’ absence from the scheduled appointments can cause.

Previous studies have looked at the economic consequences of a patient’s no-show. Mesa et al. [1] pointed out that the cost of rescheduling an appointment is approximately 13 euros, and showed that in Spain, the cost generated by patient no-shows was around 3 million euros. To reduce these adverse effects, health centers have implemented various strategies, including overbooking [2,3,4] and reminders [5,6,7].

Despite the development of medical scheduling systems to achieve better appointment management, the high rate of missed appointments still remains a problem. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in the last decades, machine learning (ML) algorithms can serve as efficient tools to understand the patients’ behavior and also to achieve better appointment allocation based on predictive models. As shown by Chong et al. [8], there was a reduction from 19.3% to 15.9% in no-shows, by sending a reminder to 25% of the patients who were indicated by the predictive model at greater risk of not attending the appointment.

There is growing interest from the healthcare community in understanding the issues involved in no-show behavior. However, identifying the features that most influence this behavior is still a challenging problem, given the variability of contexts in healthcare centers. Thus, by aggregating studies that focus on understanding the no-show behavior in medical appointments using machine learning techniques, it is possible to address the problem properly. Moreover, no updated systematic literature review exists in this field.

AI agents can significantly enhance data analysis by automating tasks, providing real-time insights, and improving accuracy. They can analyze data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions based on evidence and context. AI agents can also adapt quickly to new data and evolving requirements, making them a flexible solution for dynamic environments. 
Here's a more detailed look at how AI agents impact data analysis:

#### 2. Improved Accuracy and Reliability:

Pattern Recognition:
AI agents, especially those using machine learning algorithms, can detect patterns and anomalies that might be missed by human analysts, leading to more precise insights.
Data Validation:
AI can automatically identify inconsistencies or errors in datasets, ensuring data quality and reliability. 

#### 3. Enhanced Decision-Making:

Informed Decisions:

By analyzing data and identifying patterns, AI agents can provide the information needed to make informed decisions. 

Proactive Insights:

Agents can proactively identify potential problems or opportunities based on data analysis, allowing for timely action. 
Adaptability:
They can adapt their analysis and recommendations based on new data and changing circumstances. 

#### 4. Specific Examples of AI Agent Applications in Data Analysis:

Marketing Analysis:

AI agents can gather, analyze, and optimize marketing data, providing insights into campaign performance and suggesting improvements. 
Financial Analysis:
Agents can analyze real-time financial data, predict market trends, and optimize investment strategies. 
Supply Chain Management:
AI agents can monitor supply chain performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize logistics. 

#### 5. Different Types of AI Agents:
