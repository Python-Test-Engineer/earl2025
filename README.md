Code examples will be able to use either Groq or OpenAI except a few which are for demo purposes only.

You will need an LLM API key.

Groq offers a free tier and uses the same API signature as OpenAI.

Free Tier with Groq: https://console.groq.com/login

## Set Up

Install requirements using either `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `uv sync`

To run LLMs, copy .env.sample to .env and add your OpenAI key or Groq API key:

- OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-TQa...
- GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_ow4T...
